AirBnB clone called RareBnB. I built the backend equipped with user auth and validation as well as the frontend.

The backend includes CRUD features for reviews, spots, and bookings, as well as images for reviews and spots.

The frontend currently includes CRUD features for spots, CR for spot images, and CRD for reviews. More frontend features are coming soon.

The technologies used to create this web application are JS, nodeJS, React/Redux, html, and css.

The rendered link for this application is: https://api-project-ma4w.onrender.com
